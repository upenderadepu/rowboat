/**
 * The editor's debounced autosave, extracted from the component so the
 * edit → save → edit → close interleavings are testable.
 *
 * Dirty tracking is GENERATION-based. Every edit bumps `editGen`; a save
 * records the generation it serialized and marks it covered on completion.
 * "Dirty" is derived (`editGen !== savedGen`), so a completing save can never
 * clear dirtiness for an edit that arrived after it began — the race a boolean
 * flag had: save A completes, clears the flag B had set, the file is closed
 * inside the debounce window, and the unmount flush skips. B was never
 * written anywhere while the UI said "Saved".
