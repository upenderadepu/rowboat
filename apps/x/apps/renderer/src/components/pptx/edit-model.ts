/**
 * The editor's in-memory edit set, and how it maps onto the C1 serializer.
 *
 * Saves are idempotent recomputations — original bytes + the whole accumulated
 * edit set — so undo/redo is just a stack of these immutable snapshots and the
 * rendered deck is always `applyEditSet(baseDeck, current)`.
 *
 * One structural constraint drives the shape of this module. The serializer
 * writes a text change either as in-place `<a:t>` splices (when paragraph/run
 * structure is unchanged) or by rebuilding the whole `<a:p>` range. A rebuild
 * overlaps the regions that `formatRuns` and `paragraphAlign` splice, and the
 * serializer fails closed on overlapping splices. So:
 *
 *  - text edits carry ORIGINAL run props and alignment, never the current
 *    formatted ones, which keeps them on the in-place path;
 *  - formatting lives only in `formats` / `aligns`, addressed by ORIGINAL
 *    (paragraph, run) indices;
 *  - once a shape's text structure diverges from the original those indices
 *    have no meaning, so formatting is dropped and disabled for that shape.
