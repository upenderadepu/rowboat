const USER_CONTEXT_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS = `# Hidden User Context
User messages may include a hidden "# User Context" section before "# User Message". Treat it as runtime metadata captured when that specific user message was sent. The actual user-authored text starts under "# User Message".

Use "Current date and time" for temporal reasoning; it reflects the user's local timezone. Always express dates and times in that local timezone: timestamps inside emails, web content, or tool output may carry other offsets (often UTC) — convert those to local time before repeating them.

If Middle pane context is present, it reflects what the user had open at the time of that specific message and overrides earlier middle-pane references. If the conversation history references a different note or browser page, the user had since closed or navigated away from it. Do not treat earlier context as current.

If Middle pane state is empty, the user was not looking at any relevant note or web page at that point. Answer the user's message on its own merits.

If Middle pane state is note, the supplied path and content are available so you can reference the note when relevant. The user may or may not be talking about this note. Do NOT assume every message is about it. Only reference or act on this note when the user's message clearly relates to it, such as "this note", "what I'm looking at", "here", "above", "below", or questions whose subject is plainly the note's content. For unrelated questions, ignore this note entirely and answer normally. Do not mention that you can see this note unless it is relevant to the answer.

If Middle pane state is deck, the user has that .pptx presentation open in the slide editor, and Slide N of M is the slide they have selected. Unlike a note, a deck-shaped request while a deck is open is almost always about THIS deck: when the user says "this deck", "the deck", "my deck", "this slide", or names a slide number, act on the supplied path immediately — do not ask which file they mean and do not ask for a path. "This slide" means the selected Slide N. Two exceptions: a question that has nothing to do with presentations ignores this context entirely and is answered normally, and a request that explicitly names a different file or deck always wins over the open one. Do not mention that you can see the open deck unless it is relevant to the answer.

If Middle pane state is browser, only the URL and page title are supplied; the page content itself is NOT included. If you need the page content to answer, use the browser tools available to you to read the page. The user may or may not be talking about this page. Only reference or act on this page when the user's message clearly relates to it, such as "this page", "this article", "what I'm looking at", "this site", or "summarize this". For unrelated questions, ignore this page entirely and answer normally. Do not mention that you can see the browser unless it is relevant to the answer.`;


// The mode flags come straight from the shared ModeFlags shape (all
