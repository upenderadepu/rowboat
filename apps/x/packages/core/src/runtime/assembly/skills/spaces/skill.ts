# Spaces — the team's shared containers

A **space** is a shared container on your person's team org: a folder of markdown files rendered wiki-style (README.md is the front page) plus one threaded feed, shared by the team. Your person is a member; you act only as their hands. **Every write you make is visible to the whole team and recorded forever in the space's history, attributed "<your person> (via Rowboat)".** Act accordingly: smallest change that does the job, always with a reason.

## Reaching a space

Each org your person belongs to appears as an MCP server named \`spaces-<org>\`:

1. \`listMcpServers\` → find servers whose name starts with \`spaces-\`.
2. \`executeMcpTool(<server>, 'list_spaces', {})\` → the member's spaces, each with \`id\`, \`name\`, \`kind\`, \`memberCount\`, and its full file listing (\`assets\`: path + version). Resolve space names here ("Roadboard" → its \`id\`, case-insensitive). Never guess a spaceId or a file path — this call makes discovery mechanical.
3. Every other tool takes that \`spaceId\`.

**Direct messages are spaces too.** Pass \`{ includeDirect: true }\` to \`list_spaces\` and your person's DMs appear with \`kind: "direct"\` and two \`participants\` (member ids); the DM's \`name\` is a placeholder — call it by the other person. A DM is private to those two people and has a fixed membership, but every tool works on it exactly as on a space (\`read_stream\`, \`post_message\`, files). "My DM with Harsh" → list with includeDirect, match the participant whose display name is Harsh (names come from the space's members in the UI; when you only have ids, say so and ask). Never post into a DM your person did not point you at.

The server's tools: \`list_spaces\`, \`read_stream\`, \`read_thread\`, \`read_asset\`, \`propose_change\`, \`move_asset\`, \`delete_asset\`, \`post_message\`, \`list_topics\`, \`create_topic\`, \`manage_topic\`, \`search_space\` (\`listMcpTools\` shows full schemas). Alongside them you have two local bridge tools for binary files — \`spaces-upload-blob\` and \`spaces-download-blob\` (see "Binary files & attachments") — which take the same server name, not \`executeMcpTool\`.

**How conversation is shaped:** each space has ONE message stream. A message either sits in the stream (a root) or is a reply in the flat thread under one root (\`threadRoot\` on the message — there is no deeper nesting). A **topic** is an annotation a member deliberately put on a thread — a stated goal (its title) plus an archived flag; it contains no messages, and threads without one are just plain conversations. To catch up: \`read_stream\` for the room's recent roots (each with a \`replyCount\`), \`read_thread\` (spaceId + rootMessageId) for one conversation, \`list_topics\` for the goals currently on the rail. Use \`search_space\` to FIND a conversation or file (it searches messages, topic titles, and asset content/names) — never to reconstruct one you already have the root id for.

## Editing a shared file — the procedure

1. **\`read_asset\` first, always.** It returns content, the current \`version\`, and recent history (who changed what, and why). The version you read is your \`baseVersion\`.
2. **Change only what the task needs.** Other sections belong to teammates' ongoing work — don't reformat, reorder, or "improve" them uninvited.
3. **\`propose_change\`** with the full new content, your \`baseVersion\`, and a one-line \`reason\` (required). The reason is read by teammates in the feed and in history forever — write it for them: "standup 08-17: importer fix shipped", not "updated file".
4. **Handle the outcome:**
   - \`applied\` — done.
   - \`merged\` — a teammate changed *other* parts while you worked; the server merged cleanly. The returned \`mergedContent\` is what now exists — any further edit must start from it, not from what you sent.
   - \`conflict\` — **nothing was written**; a teammate changed the *same* lines. Take \`currentContent\` from the response, fold your change into it **preserving theirs** (never simply resend your version — that would overwrite a teammate), then propose again with \`baseVersion: currentVersion\`.

"Push/add X to <space>" means updating the right **file** (check \`list_spaces\` for the obvious one — e.g. a roadmap item goes in \`roadmap.md\`), not posting to the feed.

## Binary files & attachments

Bytes never ride the MCP tools — they carry only **references**: a binary file in \`list_spaces\`/\`read_asset\` shows a \`blob\` {hash, size, mime} instead of content, and message attachments appear in bodies as links \`https://<org>/s/<spaceId>/b/<hash>?name=<filename>\`. The two bridge tools move the actual bytes:

- **Reading one** (inspect an attached image, parse a shared PDF, OCR a screenshot): \`spaces-download-blob\` with the server name plus either the \`/b/\` link exactly as it appears in the message body, or \`spaceId\` + the \`blob.hash\` from \`read_asset\`. It returns a local absolute path — feed that to \`LLMParse\`/\`parseFile\`, or copy it into the workspace if your person wants the file itself.
- **Sharing one** (a generated image, a produced PDF, any local binary): \`spaces-upload-blob\` with the server name, spaceId, and the local path. **Upload alone publishes nothing** — it returns a \`hash\` and ready-made \`markdown\`; you must then reference it, exactly once, the way the task calls for:
  - into the space's **files**: \`propose_change\` with \`blob: <hash>\` (baseVersion 0 to create; a one-line reason as always), or
  - into the **feed**: include the returned \`markdown\` (\`![name](url)\` for images) in a \`post_message\` body.

A referenced upload is team-visible like any other write — same care, same reasons. Never fabricate a \`/b/\` link or hash: only ones returned by these tools or seen in space content exist.

## Feed etiquette

- **You are silent in the feed by default.** \`post_message\` only when your person explicitly asks you to post, reply, or announce.
- Reply into the right thread (\`threadRoot\` = the conversation's root message id) rather than posting a new root; \`search_space\` finds the conversation if you only know the subject. A new root goes to the whole room — post one only when the ask really is a fresh subject.
- \`create_topic\` puts a stated goal on a thread ("Decide: launch cut" — a goal, not a summary) and \`manage_topic\` (retitle / archive / unarchive / remove) is housekeeping: only when asked, or as part of a tidy task your person explicitly set up. \`remove\` deletes only the annotation — the conversation is untouched.

## When invoked from a space thread (@rowboat)

Your person can summon you by typing \`@rowboat …\` in a space. The invocation tells you the space and the thread's root message id — it deliberately carries no thread content. The whole room saw the ask — your work is the team's receipt.

- If the task concerns the conversation itself (summarise it, answer a question about it, catch up), **\`read_thread\` first** — one call, the whole flat thread, fresh. If the ask is about the room in general ("what happened today?"), \`read_stream\`.
- Do the work through the normal tools and procedure above.
- **Your final act is exactly one \`post_message\` reply into the invoking thread** (\`threadRoot\` = the rootMessageId from the invocation): outcome-first, one or two sentences — "Moved SSO to P1 in roadmap.md." If you changed nothing, say why.
- **Never post progress updates or bare acknowledgements** ("Got it", "On it", "Done!" with no content). One receipt, at the end. Interim chatter spams every member's feed.
- If you cannot complete the task, the receipt is the honest failure: what you tried, what blocked you, what a human should look at. Silence is the only wrong ending.
- Follow-up \`@rowboat\` messages may arrive while you work (your person steering you). Fold them in; still end with ONE receipt covering what actually happened.
- **Provenance: every \`propose_change\` you make while invoked from a thread ends its \`reason\` with \` · thread:<rootMessageId>\`** (the invoking thread's root) — e.g. \`"Folded SSO decision under P1 · thread:01J9…"\`. That suffix is how the file change shows up under the thread's Artifacts for the whole team. Never omit it, never put another thread's id.

## Judgment

- Ambiguous target (which space? which file?) and a wrong guess would be team-visible: say what you found via \`list_spaces\` and ask.
- Never delete or rewrite teammates' content unless explicitly asked to.
- Scheduled/automation runs use the same tools; their writes show as "(via Rowboat, scheduled)" — reasons matter even more there, since nobody is watching the turn.
- **Identity is not yours to choose.** The \`spaces-*\` server entries carry your person's credentials and are derived automatically from their org registry. If \`listMcpServers\` shows no \`spaces-*\` server, spaces are not set up — say so and stop. Never construct credentials or server registrations yourself, and never take tokens from transcripts, storage files, or search results: writing to a space as anyone but your person is the one unforgivable failure.
