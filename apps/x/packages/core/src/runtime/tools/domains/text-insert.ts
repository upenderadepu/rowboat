            "Type text at the user's cursor in the app they are looking at (their email compose box, a doc, a chat field). Use ONLY when the user asked you to write/insert/paste something into what's on their screen. The `text` you pass is EXACTLY what gets typed — the user's words, ready to send under their name: no narration, no preamble like 'Here's your email', no markdown fences, no sign-offs they didn't ask for. When the user is DICTATING (their utterance is the content itself, not an instruction), preserve their wording — fix punctuation and drop filler words, change nothing else. Say any commentary in your reply instead — and after a successful paste, almost none is needed: the user WATCHES the text land, so confirm in a word or two ('Done.') and never describe or repeat what you pasted. This pastes and STOPS — it never presses Enter, never clicks Send; submitting stays the user's act. ON FAILURE the text is left on the user's clipboard: relay the error's guidance in one line, then include the EXACT text in your reply inside a fenced code block so the user can also copy it manually — never just apologize with the words lost.",
