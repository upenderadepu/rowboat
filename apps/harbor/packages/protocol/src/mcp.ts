// Decision 5 (CONTRACT.md): the agent face — direct projections of the core
// operations; the MCP server attributes every call as the token's member with
// actingMode 'agent' (or 'scheduled' when the client declares it). Two
// properties are load-bearing (spec §9):
//   1. Semantics live in the tool design — list_spaces makes discovery
//      mechanical (space ids + file listings in one call, no README-link
//      convention required), read_asset bundles recent history, and a
//      propose_change conflict returns current content + history, so ANY
//      well-behaved agent gets read-before-write and retry for free.
//   2. Rowboat's own agent uses these exact tools — no privileged path.
// The agent navigates the same conversation model as the UI (annotation model
// 2026-09-01): one stream of root messages, flat threads behind reply chips,
// topics as archivable annotation rows on threads.
// NOTE: `reason` is REQUIRED here though optional on the render face. The spec's
// convention ("agents essentially always attach a why") is enforced where only
// agents call.
